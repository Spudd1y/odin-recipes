    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>3 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>3 celery sticks, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
            <li>large glass red wine (optional)</li>
            <li>850ml beef stock</li>
            <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>few thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>For the mash</li>
    
            <li>1.8kg potatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>225ml milk</li>
            <li>25g butter</li>
            <li>200g strong cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1¼ kg beef mince until browned – you may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.</li>
          <li>Put the other 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.</li>
          <li>Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins – if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.</li>
        <li>Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with </li>
        <li>Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden.</li>
      </ol>
